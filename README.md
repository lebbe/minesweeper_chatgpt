# Minesweeper

[Test me out here!](https://lebbe.github.io/minesweeper_chatgpt/)

This version of Minesweeper was made by ChatGPT. I added controls and style with the help
of Copilot. I used my own custom made version of ChatGPT,
"[Just the Code](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-nwYx83z7Q-just-the-code)", which is focused
on delivering React Typescript code without jabbering on about what happens in the code.
